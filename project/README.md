# Project Description

### Primary Tools
1. R studio
2. Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Process
We first use Python to read the data and do some data cleaning to choose the variables we are particularly interested in. Then we export the dataset to R studio to do some exploratory data analysis. Using R, we then plot the data to analyze users' habits for each of the five App stores (see code in CDC_EDA.Rmd). Based on the pattern from users' feedback, we come out with some suggestions for App stores and providers to better serve their current customers. Besides, given the large amount of data, we also use python to do the modeling, which predicts user's preference of phone brands based on their Gender, Age, Marital status, Occupation, income, etc (see code in CDC_Model.ipynb). In this way, we are able to further indentify potential customers for different kinds of mobile applications. Thus, the app stores may use our model to better recommend products to their users according to their profile.
